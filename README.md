This package offer a class to handle the PQLX database and on the creation of 
the PSD and PDF plots. The final goal is to implement an WebService to serve
PSD and PDF data to a set of rich web-pages.

On Debian the "better" way to install is using the pip system on local user account.

```
% pip install records --no-deps
```

and later, I fill in the dependencies manually by try-and-error.
